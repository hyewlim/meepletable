## Description

Meeple Table's primary concept is to facilitate connections among boardgamers and simplify the process of locating game sessions with fellow players.

## User

The platform includes a comprehensive user management system, which empowers users to reset their passwords in case they forget them. The system operates by sending an email to the user, containing a link and a token. Once the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to the password reset page. If the token is legitimate, the user will be able to effortlessly change their password.

## Game Collection

It is possible for users to include games in their personal game collection using the platform. The search bar incorporates an autocomplete API sourced from the boardgamegeek XML. When a game is successfully added to the collection, its specifics are automatically populated into the table. Additionally, users have the option of adding comments to their games within the collection, enabling them to refer back to them at a later stage.

## Meetup

Users can arrange game sessions using our platform by supplying relevant session information. These sessions will be visible in the interface, enabling other users to participate if they wish. Additionally, a map is incorporated into the page, which assists users to locate nearby sessions.


### Chat

In the event that users require additional information from the host, they have the option of joining a chatroom that is exclusively assigned to the relevant game session.

## Calendar

Furthermore, the platform features a calendar page that facilitates users in swiftly identifying the available sessions for a given month.
